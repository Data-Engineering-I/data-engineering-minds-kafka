# SASL_SSL
This repository contains the configuration files for zookeeper, Kafka brokers, producers, and consumers for launching a basic 3-node kafka cluster with SASL_SSL security.

## Note
Please remember just for showing a demo, I have shown the password directly inside the property files. Please never do that on a production environment; oor make sure that the property files are placed inside admin-only directorires with highly restricted access.
