This repository contains the below components that I use for my [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCya8wCkH9PSQQgT-50ohYvQ) Kafka videos:
1. **config** - You can find the config files for launching a 3-node kafka cluster locally without any securtity, with ssl security and with sasl_ssl security.
2. **kafka-clients** - Simple examples for Kafka applications (for example - producer/consumer) in different clients such as Python, Scala, etc..
